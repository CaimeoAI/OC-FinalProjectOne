            <h1>Fungus, the Plastic of tomorrow</h1>
            <p>Plastic changed the course of manufacturing forever, but a lot of that came at a cost that’s plaguing us
                now. About 91% of plastic isn’t recycled and we consume about 5 grams of micro plastic waste in our food
                every week.1 2 But there’s a possible solution: fungus. Yes, fungus. Mycelium technology might be the
                next big boom … like this mycelium brick … a plastic-like replacement with many uses and new
                opportunities for products … maybe even wearable technology. Let’s explore mycelium technology and how
                it can help us achieve a more renewable and cleaner future … and one where we don’t end up eating so
                much plastic.</p>

            <h2>History of Polymers</h2>
            <article class="mcp1">
                <p>When we think about plastics, different types, shapes, colors and sizes, like soda bottles, spring to
                    mind. But, from a chemist’s perspective, they’re all are made of the same class of materials:
                    polymers. While Bakelite, which was the first synthetic plastic created from organic compounds, was
                    created in 1907, polymers weren’t discovered until 1920 by Hermann Staudinger. A polymer is a broad
                    term that encompasses a substance with large molecules made up of repeating subunits that are bonded
                    together.

                <p>Just as it was for several other materials, World War II was a great impetus for the development of
                    plastic and chemical innovations, like Polyethylene, Polystyrene, and Nylon. It’s kind of a dark
                    side of innovation, but war can help accelerate things. Later in the 1950s, plastics manufacturers
                    started to make consumer products as an outlet for the materials they developed in the war. To quote
                    the movie “The Graduate,” “Just one word … Plastics.” During that decade, manufacturers introduced
                    polyester and polypropylene, one of the most used polymers in the world.

                <p>Plastics have made our life a lot easier to store liquid and food, it costs much less than other
                    materials, it’s water and heat resistant, and durable. Sadly, the plastic industry oversold it’s
                    recyclability … it’s cheaper to make new than to recycle old. Combine that with its excessive use
                    and non-biodegradable nature and plastics have become one of the most wide-spread, harmful
                    substances around the world.

                <p>n America, 100 billion plastic bags are thrown away every year, not to mention all other packaging
                    materials made of plastics that are discarded. The problem is that they can hang around in the
                    environment for hundreds of years, and burning plastics releases toxic chemicals that can harm
                    plants and animals. But it turns out that we may have a robust, sustainable alternative to replace
                    plastic: Mycelium. This organism is the underground, root-like body for fungi that produce
                    mushrooms. So if you compare it to a plant, mycelium is the root and the mushroom is the flower. The
                    mushrooms that we eat are only a small, visible part of a much larger organism.

            <h2>About Mushrooms</h2>

            <article class="mcp5">
                <p>Fungi are important in ecosystems due to their ability to recycle nutrients, allowing previously
                    locked away nutrients to become available to other organisms, like plants. And they’re surprisingly
                    robust and able to spread easily under the right conditions. All it takes is a few spores to
                    germinate. As it grows it releases enzymes to digest the surroundings and absorb the nutrients.
                    Eventually the cells begin to branch out and continue to grow to build a vast mycelial network, and
                    it’s only when it’s fully built that mushrooms begin to grow. And this is where we can tap into its
                    potential.

            <article class="mcp6">
                <p>Rather than letting a mushroom pop up, humans can create forms around the mycelium as they grow to
                    build predictable structures by providing a framework. This is an example of mycelium grown into a
                    brick form. It’s not that different from using molds with inorganic materials like metal or plastic.
                    We’re just letting Mother Nature do the work. The production process is kind of simple. It uses a
                    mix of agricultural waste, which could be anything from hemp to wood chips, and it’s bound with
                    mycelium structures.

            <article class="mcp7">
                <p>After that, we have the base material for most mycelium-based products, known as the foam. This
                    mixture is put in molds for whatever you’re trying to make, and placed in an environment with
                    controlled CO2, humidity levels, airflow, and temperature. It’s a pretty quick process. Fibers can
                    be found after just a few hours and a visible layer after a day or two. Usually within a week the
                    mycelium foam fills the mold. Overall, it takes about a week.

            <article class="mcp8">
                <p>Mycelium technology has spawned a lot of companies from several industries around the world. The
                    pioneer was Ecovative, which introduced mycelium technology in 2006. With more than 40 patents in 31
                    countries, most mycelium composites and materials out there are actually made under their license.

                alt="myceliumblock">

            <article class="mcp9">
                <p>Ecovative developed several branches of products. Its MycoFlex™ technology, for example, is used to
                    produce everything from lightweight insulating lofts for gloves to high-performance foams in
                    footwear. It’s heat resistant, insulating, breathable, and strong.

            <article class="mcp10">
                <p>In packaging materials, they’ve created a high-performing, cost-competitive solution that provides
                    thermal insulation, water resistance, and decomposes in the soil within 45 days. It’s a great
                    alternative for polystyrene. Even better, mushroom-based packaging uses only 12% of the energy from
                    plastic production and generates 90% less CO2 equivalents. Some examples of companies licensing this
                    technology are the Magical Mushroom Company is the U.K., Paradise Packaging Co in California,
                    Grown.bio in the Netherlands, and BioFab in New Zealand. And IKEA announced that they’re going to
                    replace styrofoam packaging with MycoComposite for all of its products.14 I wonder if they’ll give
                    it a name?
